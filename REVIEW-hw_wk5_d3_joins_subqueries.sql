--1. List all customers who live in Texas (use JOINs)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.address_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address, a.district
FROM customer c
JOIN address a
ON c.address_id = a.address_id
WHERE district = 'Texas'
ORDER BY c.customer_id;


--2. Get all payments above $6.99 with the Customerâ€™s full name
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, p.amount
FROM payment p
JOIN customer c 
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id 
WHERE p.amount > 6.99
ORDER BY c.last_name;


--3. Show all customer names who have made payments over $175 (use subqueries)
--In Class -- Brian used SUM, as in people who've spent an aggregated amount > 175
SELECT *
FROM customer 
WHERE customer_id IN (
	SELECT customer_id 
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id 
	HAVING sum(amount) > 175
);


	--this gets all the rows where amount > 175
SELECT c.customer_id, c.last_name, c.first_name, p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customer c 
JOIN payment p 
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.amount > 175
ORDER BY p.payment_id DESC;

	--this shows the 3 names of people who made payments over $175
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name
FROM customer c 
WHERE c.customer_id in (
	SELECT p.customer_id
	FROM payment p 
	WHERE amount > 175
	ORDER BY amount
);


--4. List all customers that live in Argentina (use the city table)
--customer TABLE -> address_id -> address TABLE
	--address TABLE -> city_id -> city TABLE
		-- city TABLE -> country_id -> country TABLE

SELECT customer_id, last_name, first_name
FROM customer
WHERE address_id IN (
	SELECT address_id
	FROM address
	WHERE city_id IN (
		SELECT city_id
		FROM city
		WHERE country_id IN (
			SELECT country_id
			FROM country
			WHERE country = 'Argentina'
		)
	)
);


--Brian's solution, using JOIN
SELECT * 
FROM customer c
JOIN address a 
ON c.address_id= a.address_id 
JOIN city ci
ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
JOIN country co
ON ci.country_id = co.country_id
WHERE country = 'Argentina';

SELECT c.name, count(*)
FROM category c
